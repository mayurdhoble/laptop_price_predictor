***Laptop Price Prediction***

This project is a machine learning model designed to predict laptop prices based on their specifications.

Project Goal:

The goal is to provide users with a tool to estimate the price of a laptop based on its various features. This can be helpful for:

Consumers: Get a sense of a fair price for a laptop before making a purchase.

Businesses: Make informed decisions about pricing their own laptops.

Data enthusiasts: Explore the application of machine learning to real-world problems.
How it Works:

The project utilizes a machine learning model trained on a dataset of laptops with their corresponding prices. Users can input the specifications of a laptop, and the model will predict its estimated price.

Features:

Machine Learning Model: The project leverages a machine learning algorithm  to analyze the data and generate price predictions.

User Interface :  implementation include a web application built with a framework like Streamlit, allowing users to easily enter laptop specifications and receive price estimations.

Install Dependencies:

The project likely uses Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn,numpy,streamlit etc.  Install them using pip install -r requirements.txt (assuming a requirements.txt file is provided).

Prepare the Data:
The project might require downloading a specific laptop dataset. Refer to the instructions within the code for details.
